### Libraries you need to install in Processing
   * <a href="http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/">controlP5</a>
   * <a href="http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/drop/">sDrop</a>
   * <a href="http://www.extrapixel.ch/processing/gifAnimation/">gifAnimation Processing Library</a>

To run the program, you don't need processing, in the main folder, there's a folder called application.macosx with a .app of the sketch that you can run without the libraries.
